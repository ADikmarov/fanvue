# Fanvue's Fullstack challenge

Setup the project:

Make sure you install all the dependencies (currently pnpm, but you can opt-out) and start the solution in dev mode.

There is a simple homepage that displays a "feed" page.

Please complete the following tasks:

- show a centered column of posts which are simple boxes with the title and body properties
- for each post, show a button with a counter of the comments, or nothing if there are no comments
- when clicking on the comment counter, the comments appear below it
- Although there is no authentication, user can add a comment to a post

Requirements:

- You must use trpc for data fetching and mutations (https://trpc.io/) this is already setup for you
- Custom styling is not required, you should use MUI5 components out-of-the box, check docs here https://mui.com/material-ui/
